This project investigated the root causes of school shootings using a case-
control methodology to identify factors that distinguish school shooters.
This study addressed these gaps in understanding of risk factors for school
shooters by using data from a systematically collected open-source database
that includes all known adolescent school shooters who injured at least one
person on school grounds in the U.S. between 1990 and 2020. The authors
enhanced these data to include two vital comparison groups: adolescents
committing shootings in the community outside school grounds as well as
non-offending students. The researchers also incorporated data from the
FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), part of the Uniform Crime
Reporting (UCR) program, covering the period from 1990 to 2019, the latest
available dataset for additional comparisons. The study employed a case-
control research design to provide a deeper understanding of how school
shooter offenders compare to the two comparison groups. The researchers
captured offender-level constructs from leading criminology theories.

This statistical brief presents findings on crimes involving juveniles,
both as victims and as alleged or perceived offenders. It includes (1)
rates of nonfatal violent victimization by age, (2) the number of deaths of
juveniles due to homicide, (3) the percentage of nonfatal violent incidents
in which the offender was perceived to be a juvenile, and (4) the
percentage of persons arrested who were juveniles. The data sources are
BJS’s National Crime Victimization Survey, the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide
Reports, and the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System.

Data cover such topics as the prevalence of victimization, teacher injury,
bullying and cyber-bullying, school conditions, fights, weapons, the
availability of drugs and student use, student perceptions of personal
safety at school, and criminal incidents at post-secondary institutions.
Indicators of crime and safety are compared across various population
subgroups and over time. When available, data on crimes that occur away
from school grounds are presented for comparison. Preliminary data indicate
that there were 53 school-associated deaths from July 1, 2012 through June
30, 2013. In 2014, among students ages 12-18, there were approximately
850,100 non-fatal victimizations and 486,400 violent victimizations. During
the 2013-14 school year, there were 1.3 million reported discipline
incidents in the United States for reasons related to alcohol, drugs,
violence, or weapons possession. The disciplinary responses included being
removed from school for at least an entire school day. Of the 781 hate
crimes reported on college campuses in 2013, the most common type of hate
crime reported by institutions was destruction, damage, and vandalism,
followed by intimidation and simple assault. The various data sources used
in the report are listed. Approximately 60 tables and 70 figures
